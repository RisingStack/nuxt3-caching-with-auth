# Nuxt 3 Caching with Authentication
## Story behind
We had a project where we aimed to optimize page load times while preserving SEO benefits. One of the techniques we employed was enabling ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration), which caches the page's HTML response on the CDN network until the TTL (Time to Live) expires. However, we also encountered challenges with parts of the pages that were user-specific, such as profile data and the number of items. These components couldn't be cached, as doing so might result in one user seeing another user's items. Addressing this issue is the focus of our article

## Project setup
### Pages
The project has 5 pages with different rendering modes enabled:
1. SSR
2. ISR without TTL
3. ISR with TTL
4. SWR without TTL
5. SWR with TTL

To learn more about rendering modes in Nuxt 3, check out our blogpost [here](https://blog.risingstack.com/nuxt-3-rendering-modes/).

[Example of page code:](pages/spa.vue)
```vue
<template>
    <div>
        <p>{{ pageType }} page</p>
        <pre>Time after hydration: {{ new Date().toUTCString() }} </pre>
        <pre>Time in server rendered HTML: {{ data }}</pre>
        <NuxtLink to="/">Home</NuxtLink>
    </div>
</template>
<script setup lang="ts">
const pageType = "SSR"; // value differs based on route
const { data } = await useFetch('/api/hello')
</script>
```

### Rendering modes
Rendering modes are set up in [nuxt.config:](nuxt.config.ts)
```javascript
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  ssr: true,
  routeRules: {
    "/isr_ttl": { isr: 60 },
    "/isr_no_ttl": { isr: true },
    "/swr_ttl": { swr: 60 },
    "/swr_no_ttl": { swr: true },
  },
});
```
### Database
For the purpose of this showcase we use [Vercel KV](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv) for a simple db-like functionality.

**Note**
Originally, we intended to use a simple object to mimic database functionality as shown in the following code snippet:

[dbFake.ts:](dbFake.ts)
```javascript
export const users = [
  {
    id: 1,
    loggedIn: false,
  },
];
```
However, this approach only works in local development and is not suitable for deployment on platforms like Vercel or Netlify, where serverless/edge functions are employed. In such environments, the server does not run continuously. Instead, a lambda function is started and then stopped whenever there is an API request. Consequently, an object on the server side cannot preserve its state.

### Server routes
Server has 4 routes:
#### api/hello
Route simply returns a current date:
```javascript
export default defineEventHandler((event) => {
  return  new Date().toUTCString();
});
```
#### api/auth
Route returns a logged in/logged out status of the first user:
```javascript
import { kv } from '@vercel/kv';

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  const loggedIn = await kv.hget("user1", "loggedIn");
  return { loggedIn };
});
```
#### api/login
Route updates the logged in status to `true` and returns this value:
```javascript
import { kv } from "@vercel/kv";

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  await kv.hset("user1", { loggedIn: true });
  const loggedIn = await kv.hget("user1", "loggedIn");
  return { loggedIn };
});
```
#### api/logout
Route updates the logged in status to `false` and returns this value:
```javascript
import { kv } from "@vercel/kv";

export default defineEventHandler(async (event) => {
  await kv.hset("user1", { loggedIn: false });
  const loggedIn = await kv.hget("user1", "loggedIn");
  return { loggedIn };
});
```

### Layout
Layout uses one header component:

[header.vue:](components/header.vue)
```vue
<template>
    <button v-if="loggedIn" @click="logout">Logout</button>
    <button v-else @click="login">Login</button>
</template>
<script setup lang="ts">
const loggedIn: Ref<boolean | undefined> = ref(false);
const { data } = await useFetch('/api/auth');
loggedIn.value = data?.value?.loggedIn;
const login = async () => {
    const response = await useFetch(
        "/api/login",
        {
            method: "PUT",
        }
    );
    loggedIn.value = response.data?.value?.loggedIn;
}
const logout = async () => {
    const response = await useFetch(
        "/api/logout",
        {
            method: "PUT",
        }
    );
    loggedIn.value = response.data?.value?.loggedIn;
}
</script>
```
This component simply renders a 'Login' button if the user isn't logged in and a 'Logout' button if the user is logged in. It includes click event handlers for each button, and these handlers call the respective API routes.

[Layout:](layouts/default.vue)
```vue
<template>
    <Header />
    <main class="main">
        <slot />
    </main>
</template>
```
### Startup
Start the example project with:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:RisingStack/nuxt3-caching-with-auth.git
cd nuxt3-caching-with-auth
pnpm install
```
Create env file based on `.env.example` and start the app:
```bash
pnpm dev
```
## User-specific data caching
If we examine our pages that should be cached with the current setup, we can observe that after logging in, upon page reload, the 'Login' button is still visible.

### SWR without TTL

The button name only updates when response changes

### SWR with TTL

The button name only updates when TTL expires

<img src="readme_assets/without_client_only/swr_ttl.gif" width="1200"/>

### ISR without TTL

The button name isn't updated as ISR without TTL means page is cached permanently

<img src="readme_assets/without_client_only/isr_no_ttl.gif" width="1200"/>

### ISR with TTL

The button name only updates when TTL expires

<img src="readme_assets/without_client_only/isr_ttl.gif" width="1200"/>

### SSR
When examining the SSR page, it functions as expected: upon the initial page load, the 'Login' button is visible. After logging in and reloading the page, the 'Logout' button is displayed.

<img src="readme_assets/without_client_only/ssr.gif" width="1200"/>

What is causing this? The issue stems from both SWR and ISR rendering modes caching the server-generated HTML response for the page. This implies that despite changes in the value provided by the API response, stale data persists in the browser until the TTL expires or the response changes, depending on the rendering mode.

## Solution
To prevent caching of specific parts of the layout, page, or component, we can wrap them within the [ClientOnly](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/components/client-only) component provided by Nuxt. This ensures that the particular slot is rendered only on the client side.

Let's modify the [default layout](layouts/default.vue):
```vue
<template>
    <Client-Only>
        <Header />
    </Client-Only>
    <main class="main">
        <slot />
    </main>
</template>
```

In addition, we need to modify the header component as `useFetch` used client-side does not fetch the data until hydration completes ([docs](https://nuxt.com/docs/api/composables/use-fetch#return-values)):

[header.vue:](components/header.vue)
```vue
[...]
<script setup lang="ts">
const loggedIn: Ref<boolean | undefined> = ref(false);
const { data } = await useFetch('/api/auth');
watch(() => data?.value?.loggedIn, () => {
    if (data.value) {
        loggedIn.value = data.value?.loggedIn
    }
})
[...]
</script>
```
This way we are watching for changes in the response and are updating values of `loggedIn` variable when they become available.

Upon checking the behavior now, it works as expected: any page reload after updating the user's logged-in status will render the correct values.
### SWR without TTL

The button name is up to date after a reload. The 'Time in server-rendered HTML' only updates when the response changes.

### SWR with TTL

The button name is up to date after a reload. The 'Time in server-rendered HTML' only updates when the TTL expires.

<img src="readme_assets/with_client_only/swr_ttl.gif" width="1200"/>

### ISR without TTL

The button name is up to date after a reload. However, the 'Time in server-rendered HTML' isn't updated, as ISR without TTL means the page is cached permanently.

### ISR with TTL

The button name is up to date after a reload. However, the 'Time in server-rendered HTML' only updates when TTL expires.

## Deploying the App to Vercel

After importing the project to Vercel and configuring the Vercel KV storage, deployment becomes a matter of a single click (refer to the [deployment information](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/overview) for more details).

It's crucial to note that the SWR rendering mode only works with [edge functions](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/nuxt#edge-functions), while ISR functions exclusively with [serverless functions](https://vercel.com/docs/frameworks/nuxt#serverless-functions). This distinction is not clearly documented â€” Vercel's documentation typically encourages the use of ISR only, without acknowledging that it doesn't support revalidation based on response changes. Consequently, we've raised a service ticket for this issue and are in communication with the Vercel team.

To enable edge functions, set the environment variable `NITRO_PRESET=vercel-edge`. Serverless functions are the default for deploying Nuxt projects to Vercel, so no additional configuration is required.

## Deploying the App to Netlify

Initially, we also planned to use Netlify for this app. However, we soon discovered that the rendering modes in Nuxt 3, which provide caching, weren't functioning correctly on Netlify. Regardless of the configuration we employed, some rendering modes didn't work as expected (for more details, refer to the [forum topic](https://answers.netlify.com/t/nuxt-3-caching-with-isr-swr-does-not-work-as-expected/110715) we opened on this issue).

Following discussions with the Netlify team, they redirected us back to Nuxt for resolution. As a result, we've opened an [issue](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt/issues/25418) on the Nuxt GitHub repository to address this matter.

## Conclusion

Opting for a rendering mode that facilitates caching is a great strategy to achieve faster load times and reduce server costs. This approach remains effective even when dealing with data on the page that requires regular updates or is user-specific. To address such scenarios, consider encapsulating the relevant components within the `<ClientOnly>` component provided by Nuxt.

For seamless one-click deployments, Vercel is a preferable choice, especially at the moment. This is due to the current issue where rendering modes supporting caching do not function correctly on Netlify. As the landscape evolves, it's advisable to stay updated on platform-specific capabilities and limitations for the optimal deployment of your Nuxt app.
